Good job getting a first-step done on the project. Part of the point of the project was to learn how to teach yourself something (and find the information you need on Google), so hopefully you will get this experience with the “next feature” you want to add to the app. 

My biggest suggestion with the interface is that you have a LOT of buttons on your home screen. In a “final” version of the app, I would suggest taking out all the buttons that you don’t need. Right now all you are using is two buttons - turning the alarm on and turning it off. You don’t need a Countdown button or the “Set an Alarm” button, because the ON and OFF buttons do those things. When you get the Random and Lucky Person buttons working, I want to see the app. The second interface suggestions is to actually give the user some kind of feedback telling them that the alarm is set. For example, when the alarm is set, have a Label show on the screen “Alarm ON”, and when it is off, have the same Label show “Alarm OFF”, so that the user knows if what they did was effective or not. I can’t wait to see the full version.
